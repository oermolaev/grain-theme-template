##Overview

###Description

Grain framework is an open source static website generator for Groovy that provides extensible mechanisms for
implementing custom static sites or generating software documentation.

####Grain features

Grain comes with the following high-level features:

 - preview mode that allows to make and see changes on the fly
 - support of embedded Groovy code for any content files (including stylesheet and JS files)
 - configurable conventions that allow to process content sources using Groovy code
 - Markdown, reStructuredText and AsciiDoctor markup support
 - code highlighting via Python Pygments
 - built-in SASS/SCSS support
 - compression and minification for sources

####Grain themes

Grain website project is called *theme*. Theme defines site structure, appearance and content arrangement.
Typically, Grain theme ships with:

 - website and Grain configuration
 - HTML page templates, called *layouts*
 - stylesheets, javascripts and images
 - code sources to process site pages (for instance, apply pagination)
 - samples of raw content files

Grain has ready-made themes that can be found [here](http://sysgears.com/grain/themes/).
It is not required to know Groovy or any other programming language to use these themes, you still can easily
manage content and set up your site.

###Requirements

To run Grain framework you need [JDK 7 or later](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
Download and install the appropriate JDK for your operating system.

###Installation

No installation required. Just download one of the [themes](http://sysgears.com/grain/themes/) and Grain will be
loaded automatically as a JAR dependency.

If you are new to Grain, we recommend to start with the ready-made [Grain Octopress](http://sysgears.com/grain/themes/octopress/)
theme, it will give you a good overview on how to efficiently use most of the Grain features. To build a website from
scratch, download the Grain [Theme Template](http://sysgears.com/grain/themes/template/).

##Getting Started

###Create website

In order to start creating your website, download one of the [themes](http://sysgears.com/grain/themes/) and unpack it
to the location of your choice.

###Preview website
Navigate to the location of your newly created website `cd /path/to/your_site` and run the command

``` sh:nl
./grainw
```

to launch your website in preview mode.

> Here and further command-line snippets work for Unix-like systems only. In case you are running Grain from
Windows simply use `grainw` command instead of `./grainw`.

After that you can view your website by pointing a web browser to `http://localhost:4000`. You can add, change or delete
website files, and see all changes in the web browser immediately after refreshing the page.

###Generate and deploy
When your site is ready for going live you can generate all the website files by executing

``` sh:nl
./grainw generate
```

The files of website will be generated to `/path/to/your_site/target` directory. 

You can deploy the resulting files either manually or with the help of Grain:

``` sh:nl
./grainw deploy
```

Check the deployment section for more information.

##Website structure

###Directories conventions

Grain has the following conventions for website files and directories: 

  - content - website content, organized the same way as in resulting website
  - theme - top level directory for the site content representation theme
    - includes - common page parts, included at the layouts side, such as header, footer, etc.
    - layouts - page layouts (templates)
    - src - any Groovy classes used for processing content
    - ... - other assets, organized the same way as in resulting website
  - SiteConfig.groovy - website configuration parameters
  
##Configuration

Grain provides `SiteConfig.groovy` file for general configuration, this file is located right in the root folder of any
Grain theme. Configuration settings are specified with the
<a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/gapi/groovy/util/ConfigSlurper.html" target="_blank">ConfigSlurper</a>
syntax.

###Predefined variables

When working with `SiteConfig.groovy`, you may use a couple of pre-defined variables:

`site` - access point to website resources and configuration

`log` - default logger

###Filesystem layout

Though in many situations you wouldn't touch default conventions, in some cases it is still beneficial
to have the possibility for more fine-grained control over Grain website structure on the filesystem.

> Default configuration settings can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/sysgears/grain/blob/master/src/main/resources/DefaultConfig.groovy" target="_blank">
src/main/resources/DefaultConfig.groovy</a> file.

You can control website filesystem layout by modifying the following parameters in the `/SiteConfig.groovy`:

`destination_dir` - destination directory for generated website files, default: <br />

``` groovy:nl
destination_dir = "${base_dir}/target"
```

`cache_dir` - directory where cache files of various Grain subsystems are stored, default: <br />

``` groovy:nl
cache_dir = "${base_dir}/.cache"
```

`source_dir` - directory or a list of directories with website sources. The directories are handled sequentially
by Grain, and if the same files with same relative locations appear in each directory, then the file from the directory
listed first takes precedence. Default: <br />

``` groovy:nl
source_dir = ["${base_dir}/content", "${base_dir}/theme", "${cache_dir}/compass"]
```

`include_dir` - directory or a list of directories with includes, default: <br />

``` groovy:nl
include_dir = ["${theme_dir}/includes"]
```

`layout_dir` - directory or a list of directories with layouts, default: <br />

``` groovy:nl
layout_dir = ["${theme_dir}/layouts"]
```

####Customizing filesystem layout

Custom destination and cache folders can be specified as the following:

``` groovy:nl
destination_dir = "${base_dir}/site"

cache_dir = "${base_dir}/.site_cache"
```

To redefine the source, include or layout folders, you should provide a list of directories, or,
if you want to keep the default settings, add your directories to the existing list loaded from
the default configuration:

``` groovy:nl
// adding a directory to the predefined list
source_dir << "${base_dir}/assets"

// redefining the folders altogether:
source_dir = ["${base_dir}/content", "${base_dir}/theme", "${base_dir}/assets"]
```

###Source processing configuration

This settings can be used for excluding files or directories located in the source folders, or for
defining assets that must be copied to the destination folder without additional processing.

`excludes` - a list of regular expressions that match locations of files or directories that must be completely
excluded from processing. These files are ignored by Grain and won't be copied to the destination directory. Default:

``` groovy:nl
excludes = ['/sass/.*', '/src/.*', '/target/.*']
```
             
`binary_files` - a list of regular expressions that match locations of binary files. Binary files are excluded from
processing, but, contrary to the files from the excludes list, will be copied to the destination directory. Default:

``` groovy:nl
binary_files = [/(?i).*\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|bmp|swf ... eot|otf|ttf|woff|woff2)$/]
```

`non_script_files` - a list of regular expressions that match locations of files which content
(see [file source](#page-file-source)) must be left unprocessed. The file headers still will be parsed,
which is useful when you need to pass some configuration options, but do not want Grain to run embedded
Groovy code. Default:

``` groovy:nl
non_script_files = [/(?i).*\.(js|css)$/]
```

####Customizing source processing settings

It is generally recommended to add new regular expressions to the default processing configuration and keep
the default settings, but, if required, you can completely redefine the configuration:

``` groovy:nl
excludes << '/misc/.*' // additionally excludes the 'misc' directory

excludes = ['/src/.*', '/target/.*'] // overwrites the default configuration
```

###Preview configuration

`jetty_port` - TCP port for serving HTTP request in preview mode (default: 4000)

###Features configuration

Grain has many features provided by different implementations. Concrete implementations are specified in the `features`
section of the configuration file.

####Markdown markup feature

`markdown` - markdown markup implementation (default: txtmark)
  
  - `txtmark` - TxtMark Markdown 
  - `pegdown` - PegDown Markdown (Since this markdown processor has been [deprecated](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown) by developers, please consider using the `flexmark_pegdown` in case you need to use pegdown for your pages.)
  - `flexmark_pegdown` PegDown implementation, provided by [Flexmark](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java)
  - `flexmark_kramdown` Kramdown Markdown
  - `flexmark_commonmark` CommonMark Markdown (this option is the default one for [Flexmark](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java))
  - `flexmark_multimarkdown` Multimarkdown Markdown

All options with names starting with "flexmark_" prefix provide markdown processors which are emulated by [Flexmark](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java).
  
####reStructuredText markup feature

There is only one implementation of reStructuredText at this time - via Python docutils. All files having `rst`
extension will be rendered using this implementation.

####Asciidoctor markup feature

All files having `adoc` or `asciidoctor` extensions will be rendered using latest asciidoc Ruby gem.

The files are converted to HTML5 with help of the `Asciidoctor.convert` method:

```ruby:nl
Asciidoctor.convert(source, :safe => 0, :attributes => attributes)
```

You can provide the custom attributes for the document conversion in the following way:

```groovy:nl
features {
    asciidoc {
        opts = ['source-highlighter': 'coderay',
                'icons': 'font']
    }
}
```

####Syntax highlighting feature

`highlight` - code highlighting method (default: none):

  - `none` - no code highlighting
  - `pygments` - code highlighting using Pygments   

`cache_highlight` - cache highlighting results (default: true):

  - `true` - cache highlighting results
  - `false` - do not cache highlighting results

####SASS/Compass feature

Grain supports defining stylesheets using SASS or SCSS files. This is done by launching external Compass process
which watches for SASS/SCSS files and recompiles them automatically. The settings for Compass should be stored
in `/config.rb` file, which is rendered to `cache_dir/config.rb` as an ordinary page and hence
can use website configuration parameters and have embedded Groovy code. The Compass process is launched in the 
`cache_dir` directory and reads settings from `config.rb`. 

####Minification and compression features

The generated files of website can be minified and compressed in various ways.

***Minification***
 
`minify_xml` - minify XML files (default: none)

  - `none` - do not minify XML files
  - `true` - minify XML files 

`minify_html` - minify HTML pages (default: none)

  - `none` - do not minify HTML files
  - `true` - minify HTML files 

`minify_js` - minify JavaScript files (default: none)

  - `none` - do not minify JavaScript files
  - `true` - minify JavaScript files 

`minify_css` - minify CSS stylesheets (default: none)

  - `none` - do not minify CSS files
  - `true` - minify CSS files 

***Compression***

`compress` - compress all generated files (default: none)

  - `none` - do not compress generated files
  - `gzip` - compress all generated files using GZIP

###Interpreters configuration

####Python interpreter

Grain uses Python interpreter in your system to execute various Python packages. If Python interpreter is not found
Grain falls back to Jython. You can specify an ordered list of Python command candidates in config.

`python.cmd_candidates` - Python command candidates (default: ['python2', "python", "python2.7"])

It is possible to force Grain to use Jython by setting the `python.interpreter` property to `jython`:

`python.interpreter` - Python interpreter (default to `auto`)
 - `auto` - use Python if it is installed in the system, otherwise fall back to Jython
 - `python` - use Python (requires Python installed)
 - `jython` - use Jython

Grain uses *setuptools* to manage Python packages. If required, you can change *setuptools* version
via `python.setup_tools` option:

`python.setup_tools` - Python *setuptools* version (default to `2.1`)

####Ruby interpreter

Grain tries to find Ruby interpreter in your system to execute various Ruby gems. If Ruby interpreter is not found
Grain falls back to JRuby. You can specify an ordered list of Ruby command candidates in config.

`ruby.cmd_candidates` - Ruby command candidates (default: ["ruby", "ruby1.8.7", "ruby1.9.3", "user.home/.rvm/bin/ruby"])

It is possible to force Grain to use JRuby by setting the `ruby.interpreter` property to `jruby`:

`ruby.interpreter` - Ruby interpreter (default to `auto`)
 - `auto` - use Ruby if it is installed in the system, otherwise fall back to JRuby
 - `ruby` - use Ruby (requires Ruby installed)
 - `jruby` - use JRuby

You can change *RubyGems* package manager version via `ruby.ruby_gems` option:

`ruby.ruby_gems` - *RubyGems* version (default value depends on Ruby version)

###Deployment configuration

Deployment of final website is implemented as shell command execution.

`deploy` - a shell command or list of shell commands to deploy a website, that are executed sequentially
 
***Example***

``` groovy:nl
s3_bucket = "www.example.com"
deploy = "s3cmd sync --acl-public --reduced-redundancy ${destination_dir}/ s3://${s3_bucket}/"
```

###Environments
Different modes of Grain operation are associated with different configuration environments. These
environments can be used to provide environment specific configuration. 

***Example***

``` groovy:nl SiteConfig.groovy
environments {
    dev {
        log.info "Development environment is used"
        // Preview-specific configuration
    }
    prod {
        log.info "Production environment is used"
        // Generate-specific configuration
    }
}
```

Grain uses the following environments:

`dev` - environment used when running Grain for website preview and development

`prod` - site generation and site deployment environment 

`cmd` - theme-specific command-mode environment, used when running a custom command
        defined in SiteConfig.groovy  
   
###Advanced configuration

####Config posthandler hook

`config_posthandler` - a closure that is executed right after each execution of `SiteConfig.groovy`
 
***Example***

``` groovy:nl
config_posthandler = { println 'Config has been just rereaded' }
```

##Page structure

###Page file source

Typical Grain page consists of page header and page content. Page header contains static page configuration parameters
formatted using YAML markup.

``` yaml:nl
---
layout: page
title: "Page title"
...
---
Page content goes here
```

Page content can be written in Markdown, HTML, XML or plain text. Grain determines content markup type based
on page file extension.

###Embedded Groovy code

Embedded Groovy code can be included anywhere in a page content, but not in the page header.
To include a simple Groovy expression one can use this notation:

``` groovy:nl
${2 + 2}
```

Or this

``` groovy:nl
<%= 2 + 2 %>
```

In both cases 4 will be inserted into the content of the page as the result of evaluation of these Groovy expressions.

To include large blocks of Groovy code one can use notation below:

``` jsp:nl
<%
    def foo = 2 + 2
%>
...
<% if (foo == 4) { %>
   <span class="true"></span>
<% } %>
``` 

The `if` above will work as expected, e.g. the span will be rendered into page contents only when the criteria is met.
Also note that variables declared in one piece of embedded code will be available anywhere on the page.

####Disabling Groovy code interpolation

To render embedded Groovy code as is, you need to disable Groovy code interpolation by using the following form of
escaping:

```
`!`${2 + 2}`!`
```

###Variables on a page
Grain has several variables reserved, others can be freely introduced on a page.

These variables are reserved:

  - `page` - current page model
  - `site` - a facade to accessing website resources and configuration
  - `content` - HTML content of the page, accessible in layout
  - `out` - internal string buffer used to accumulate page contents during rendering

####Page variable

`page` variable provides access to all the keys of pages YAML headers.

For example to get page title one can use the following code snippet:

``` jsp:nl
${page.title}
```

Grain generates the following header keys on initial loading of resource from source file:

  - `location` - relative page location on the filesystem, for example `/index.html`
                 or `/contacts/index.markdown`
  - `url` - URL of the page
  - `type` - resource type, either 'page' for resources that render into HTML or `asset` for all the other
             resources
  - `dateCreated` - resource file creation time in milliseconds
  - `lastUpdated` - resource file last update time in milliseconds
  - `text` - text contents of resource file
  - `bytes` - byte contents of resource file
  - `script` - indicates whether the embedded Groovy code processing is enabled for the file (false if the file location
  matches an expression from the `non_script_files` configuration list, true otherwise)

`page` variable is just a Groovy map. You can add keys to this map in the page code
or make other changes, but these changes are only visible to the page itself,
they will not be visible to other pages.

####Site variable

`site` variable provides access to all the properties declared in SiteConfig.groovy. For example, in order to get
configured URL of the site one can use this code:

``` jsp:nl
<a href="${site.url}">Home</a>
```

`site` also exposes all the pages of the site in `site.pages`, all the asset files of the site
in `site.assets` and both assets and pages in `site.resources`. For example to dump the value of title
defined in every site page one could do:

``` jsp:nl
<%= site.pages.collect { it.title } %>
```

###Disabling code processing

Besides defining whether the page content will be processed using the `non_script_files` configuration setting:

``` groovy:nl
non_script_files = [/(?i).*\.(js|css)$/]
```

You can overwrite the configuration for a single file by changing the value of the `script` key in the header:

``` yaml:nl
---
script: true # true - evaluate embedded Groovy expressions, false - render the page content as is
#...
---
```

This usually comes in handy when you need to pass variables to stylesheet or javascript files.

##Layouts

###Concept
Rendered page content usually wrapped up by layout, where most of the presentation logic is held.

Here is an example of a layout:

``` jsp /theme/layout/default.html
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>${site.title}</title>
</head>

<body>
  <div id="main">
    <div id="content">
      ${content}
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Please note that rendered page contents is passed in `content` variable to the layout.

###Layout nesting 
One layout can be based on another layout. For example, here is some page layout, based on default layout above:

``` jsp /theme/layout/page.html
---
layout: default
title: "Default page title"
---
<div class="page">
    ${content}
</div>
```

Layout nesting can be unlimited.

##Includes

###General idea
Common page presentation parts can be kept in separate files and then included into layouts.

For example in the code below sidebar.html is included into layout:

``` jsp /theme/layout/page.html
---
layout: default
title: "Default page title"
---
...
${include 'sidebar.html'}
```

###Passing custom model
In some cases you would want to pass some variables to the included parts:

``` jsp /theme/layout/blog.html
---
layout: page
---
...
           <footer>
             <a href="${page.url}">Read More</a>
             ${include 'tags.html', [tags: page.categories]}
           </footer>
```

After that, inside tags.html, you will have `page.tags` set to the value of `page.categories`.

##URL and resource mapping

###Introduction

It is obvious that in order to implement some complex tasks for your website, you may need to have full control over
your website resources. For example, you may want to customize website urls, add custom pages, like pagination pages or
pages that gathers posts related to certain tags, etc.
All sorts of this transformations can be made by using resource mapping mechanism. In order to start working with it,
it is important to be familiar with how website resources are represented in Grain.

###Resource representation
In Grain each resource is represented as a plain Groovy map. Each resource should have at least three keys in its map:

-  either `location` which points to the resource file in filesystem, or `source` which contains resource content
- `markup` - resource markup, one of 'html', 'md', 'rst', 'adoc', 'text' or 'binary' (it is optional if `location` is defined)
- `url` - the URL of the resource (it is not strictly tied to the resource location, and can be modified)

Both `source` and `markup` have higher priority over `location` when Grain decides what contents should be rendered and
what markup should be used for rendering

Along with these keys, resource representation holds all the properties specified in content files' headers.

###Default Resource URL

Grain assigns a default resource URL based on the resource location. For example: if the favicon.ico is placed
in the /images/icons/ folder, the icon's default url will be the /images/icons/favicon.ico.

Additionally, Grain rewrites a file extension for `.md`, `.adoc` and `.rst` files, so they can be rendered by a browser:

``` :nl
file location    -> file url

/test.adoc       -> /test.html
/test.markdown   -> /test.html
/test/test.adoc  -> /test/test.html
/test/test.rst   -> /test/test.html
```

###Resource processing phases

Grain processes all the resources located in the source directories in the following way:

 - scans all the `source_dirs` listed in the `SiteConfig.groovy`, and loads the raw list of resources
 - parses headers of all the found non-binary resources, and then puts the headers as well as other important
information, like resource `location`, `url`, and `markup`, to the resource representation map
 - passes all the found resources to the ResourceMapper closure. You can use this closure (described in the next section)
to modify the list of resources in any way: add new pages or assets, change their URLs, update content and headers, remove
pages, etc. The outcome of this phase is a modified list of resources, which may contain new assets and pages.
 - adds all the resources returned by the resource mapper to the url registry and generates the pages by resolving
layouts and executing tag libraries.

###Mapping customization

As mentioned above, the list of all the site resources is passed to the `SiteConfig.groovy -> resource_mapper` closure.
The closure is expected to build new list of resources that may have customized URLs, modified resource variables, etc.

For example the input list of resources might look like this:

``` groovy:nl
[
    [location: '/articles/my-new-post-title.markdown', url: '/articles/my-new-post-title/'],

    [location: '/blog/index.html', url: '/blog/']
    ...
]
```

And the output could be as follows:

``` groovy:nl
[
    [location: '/articles/post-sample-with-code.markdown',
        url: '/blog/2013/10/21/post-sample-with-code/'],

    [location: '/blog/index.html', url: '/blog/'],

    [location: '/blog/index.html', url: '/blog/page/2/',
        posts: [location: '/articles/post-sample-with-code.markdown', ...]],

    [location: '/blog/index.html', url: '/blog/page/3/'
        posts: [...]]
]
```

Note how one physical resource `/blog/index.html` is mapped here to different URLs and each time `/blog/index.html` will
receive additional model variable `posts`.

####Resource mapper closure

`resource_mapper` - a closure that is executed each time website changes for transforming initial resource models

***Parameters***:

  1. List of initial resource models

***Return value***: transformed resource models to be used for actual rendering of resources

***Example***

``` groovy:nl
resource_mapper = { resources ->
    resources.collect { Map resource ->
        if (resource.location =~/\/blog\/.*/) {
            // Select all the resources, which content files placed under /blog dir
            // Rewrite url for blog posts
            def unParsedDate = resource.date //Date specified in content file's header
            def date = Date.parse(site.datetime_format, resource.date).format('yyyy/MM/dd/')
            def title = resource.title.toLowerCase().replaceAll("\\s+","-")
            resource + [url: "/blog/$date$title/"]
        } else {
            resource
        }
    }
}
```

###Dynamic rendering
Resource in Grain can be rendered dynamically anywhere, to do this one should assemble resource map and call
method render() on it.

Example:

``` groovy:nl
[source: '**Bold text**', markup: 'adoc'].render()
```

Example of using dynamic rendering inside page:

``` jsp:nl
<div>
    ${[source: '**Bold text**', markup: 'adoc'].render()}
</div>
```

##Tag libraries

###Standard tag library
Grain provides standard tags for most vital tasks, additional tags are recommended to be added to custom theme tag lib.

The standard tags are:

 - **`r`** - looks up resource URL by resource location. Finds CDN url of the resource if `cdn_urls` property is defined
 in the `SiteConfig.groovy`, or, alternatively, generates the resource url using the `link` tag.

    ######Parameters:
       1. Resource location
 
    ######Example:
    ``` jsp:nl
    <link href="${r '/favicon.png'}" rel="icon">``` 
  - **`link`** - generates an url from a relative link to a resource (for example, */path/to/resource.ext*). 
  This tag allows you to insert absolute or relative links depending on a value of the `site.generate_absolute_links` 
  boolean variable. If `site.generate_absolute_links` variable is set to **true**, then Grain just concatenates the 
  `site.url` property (*http://domain.com/your-app*) and a resource link (for example, setting the `'.'` value as a 
  parameter of the `site.url` will result in creating an absolute path - *./path/to/resource.ext*). And if 
  `site.generate_absolute_links` variable is set to **false**, or is not set at all, then Grain tries to extract a 
  path from the `site.url` and prepend it to the resource link (*/your-app/path/to/resource.ext*). 
 
    ######Parameters:
       1. Relative link
  
    ######Example:
    ``` jsp:nl
    <link href="${link '/blog/post'}">```
 - **`rs`** - looks up multiple resource URLs by their locations

    ######Parameters:
      1. Resource location list

    ######Example:
    ``` jsp:nl
    <% rs(['/javascripts/libs/jquery.min.js',
    '/javascripts/modernizr-2.0.js',
    '/javascripts/octopress.js',
    '/javascripts/github.js',
    '/javascripts/jquery.tweet.js',
    '/javascripts/twitter-options.js']).each { script -> %>
    <script src="${script}" type="text/javascript"></script><% } %>```
 - **`include`** - inserts rendered resource contents

    ######Parameters:
      1. Template location
      1. *(Optional)* Additional model variables added to `page` map

    ######Example:

    ${include 'tags.html', [tags: post.categories]}```
 - **`md5`** - calculates md5 hash of a byte array

    ######Parameters:
      1. Byte array

    ######Example:
    ``` jsp:nl
    md5(resource.render().bytes)```

###Custom tag libraries
You can add your own tags in your website theme. This can be made by implementing your tags as Groovy closures.

Class with tag closures should be added into the list of tag libs in `SiteConfig.groovy -> tag_libs`.
The tag lib class constructor should expect one argument - standard Grain taglib.
 
Example:

``` groovy:nl SiteConfig.groovy
import com.example.grain.taglib.MyTagLib
...
tag_libs = [OctopressTagLib, MyTagLib]
```

``` groovy:nl /theme/src/com/example/grain/taglib/MyTagLib.groovy
package com.example.grain.taglib

import com.sysgears.grain.taglib.GrainTagLib

class MyTagLib {

    /**
     * Grain taglib reference.
     */
    private GrainTagLib taglib

    public MyTagLib(GrainTagLib taglib) {
        this.taglib = taglib
    }

    /**
     * Renders a brief from the markdown post, delimited by <!--more--> 
     *
     * @attr markdown post content
     */
    def renderBrief = { String markdown ->
        Processor.process(markdown.split('<!--more-->').head())
    }

    ...

}
```

##Custom command-line commands

###Creating your own commands
It can be beneficial to add support for new custom commands to Grain command-line for pre-populating new pages, posts,
etc.

All the commands supported by theme should be stored into `commands` list property in `SiteConfig.groovy`. Each command
in this list is a closure that accepts zero or more String parameters that is passed from command-line.

***Example***

``` groovy:nl
commands = [
new_post: { String postTitle ->
    def date = new Date()
    def fileDate = date.format("yyyy-MM-dd")
    def filename = fileDate + "-" + postTitle.toLowerCase().replaceAll("\\s+","-") + ".markdown"
    def file = new File(content_dir + "/blog/" + filename)
    file.exists() || file.write("""---
layout: post
title: "${postTitle}"
---
""")},
...
]
```
